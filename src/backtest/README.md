# Backtester Automated
## At minimum, a backtester should:

1. Take a ticker + time period (e.g., TSLA, last 1 year).

2. Loop through historical prices day by day.

3. Run your agents on each dayâ€™s data.

4. Follow their signals (buy/sell/hold).

5. Track a simple portfolio value (cash + stock holdings).
